			<figcaption>Even if you live in Prince Edward County, it can be a long drive to the end of Long Point Road where Peptbo is located. 
			  This location makes it a prime stopover point for migratory birds making the journey across Lake Ontario.</figcaption>

			<p> Volunteering at the bird banding station gives me the chance to handle some beautiful birds, including species at risk such as Bobolinks and Canada Warblers</p>

			<p> When you look at the feathers under an ultra-violet light, the poriphryn pigments will cause certain feathers to become fluorescent pink, which helps to determine the age of the individual. </p>

			<p>Aging and sexing birds in the Amazon is much more difficult because they breed at any time of year. However, sometimes you get lucky and see a flamboyant male like this Blue-headed Manakin </p>
